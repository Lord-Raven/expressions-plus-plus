# Expressions Extension for Chub(++)

This is a shameless rip-off of the [official Expression Packs stage](https://chub.ai/extensions/BartlebyTheScrivener/expressions-extension-768927333d4d),
but with generated character images and backgrounds.

The problem with this extension is that it actually can't access the expression packs that bot-makers have attached to their bots. 
This data appears to be currently reserved for the official stage, although I expect this is not the long-term intent. 
When this changes, I will make updates to ensure this stage can leverage those images, as well.
