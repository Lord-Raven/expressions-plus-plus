This is a shameless knock-off of the [official Expression Packs stage](https://chub.ai/extensions/BartlebyTheScrivener/expressions-extension-768927333d4d).  

### No Expression Pack Support 

_However_, unlike that stage, this one doesn't actually support expression packs; they appear to currently be locked to the official stage. Write your congressperson. 
When this changes, I'll update this stage to use the character's pack by default.  

### So, Uh, What Is This, Then? 

This stage generates its own expression images by producing a visual description of each character and 
then making lots of image generation calls.  

Images may initially take time to appear as they must be generated up front; they are lazy loaded, so you can continue to chat while the stage gets things ready. 
The result is that it works with any character, but _it uses lots of image generation tokens_ (if you aren't paying for Mars), and your mileage may vary.  

This stage also generates background images based on the scene. These are also lazy loaded, but because they are history-sensitive, 
it is currently very easy to get the background out of sync with the chat.  

### Improvements over the original 

- This stage discards neutral emotion determinations when a secondary emotion is over a certain threshold, which causes characters to appear more expressive.
- This stage can be used with any character (although I expect it will not be great for non-character bots).
- This stage has some fancy multi-character support.
- This stage adds backgrounds.

### External Dependences 

This stage leverages [SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions](https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions) for emotion inference ([my HF space for this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ravenok/emotions)) 
and [MoritzLaurer/ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0) for zero-shot classification ([my HF space for that](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ravenok/statosphere-backend)).
