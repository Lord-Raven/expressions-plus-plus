This is a shameless knock-off of the [official Expression Packs stage](https://chub.ai/extensions/BartlebyTheScrivener/expressions-extension-768927333d4d).


_However_, unlike that stage, this one doesn't actually support expression packs; they appear to currently be locked to the official stage. 


**So, uh, what is this, then?**<br>
This stage generates its own expression images by producing a visual description of each character and 
then making lots of image generation calls. 


Images my initially take time to appear as they must be generated up front; they are lazy loaded, so you can continue to chat while the stage gets things ready.


The result is that it works with any character, but _it uses lots of image generation tokens_ (if you aren't paying for Mars), and your mileage may vary.


This stage also generates background images based on the scene. These are also lazy loaded, but because they are history-sensitive, it is currently very easy to get the background out of sync with the chat.


**External Dependences**<br>
This stage leverages [SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions](https://huggingface.co/SamLowe/roberta-base-go_emotions) for emotion inference ([my HF space for this](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ravenok/emotions)) 
and [MoritzLaurer/ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0](https://huggingface.co/MoritzLaurer/ModernBERT-large-zeroshot-v2.0) for zero-shot classification ([my HF space for that](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Ravenok/statosphere-backend)).
